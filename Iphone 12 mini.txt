  Its awesome. Its my first iPhone and I started loving it. You might have to buy Apple's 20W adapter if you want to have fast charging experience. But overall it is a cute small but very powerful device. Absolutely technical magic from Apple!!

   Believe me guys... I got it in 60,490 after using that offer on credit card. Obviously a steal deal. But the phone is awesome , battery life , camera and its functionality my god.. I actually bought this for the camera specs. You can blindly click , record , edit and share using the phone only. You dont need any laptop unless you need to edit some very high 4k or professional files.Just go for it. It wont disappoint you.

  1. This is my first Apple phone. Also I wanted a small sized phone. So this is good for me.2. I don't use phone much. For social media like insta, FB, YouTube I use only for 1 hour. So battery life isn't a problem for me. I charge it in the morning and it goes till 8-9 PM. And still it works. The phone never got to 0% battery.3. I switched off the automatic brightness option for the battery to last long.4. Usually I switch on the mobile data or wifi if only I am using it continuously. Otherwise I keep it off. It saves me from unnecessary notifications and also help me keep the battery alive. I used to do it even when I was using and Android phone.5. If you need a small phone and if you are an average user of phone then you can go for it. But if you are a heavy user I would recommend iPhone 12 or the bigger versions - 12 pro max.. Etc.6. Very powerful. Convenient to use. And the most beautiful thing is it is small and goes inside my pocket so comfortably.7. Do use a cover/case. That way you can increase the grip. Otherwise it may slip away from your hands.8. I have also purchased an apple charger 20 W. So it gets charged faster.9. Firstly it was a little difficult for me to move from Android to iPhone. But trust me you'll get used to it. I am still learning it's features and tricks to use.10. I won't write about the specifications coz those are available.

  This is my first-time experience IOS/iPhone because I have been an Android user from the start. I was tired of the large phone, and I was looking for a compact phone, but there is no option available on the Android side hence, I switched to an iPhone. Here are my initial experience, I won't call it a value for money phone even after applying the offers, it's still a bit expensive.Pros:1. Camera: I don't take that many photos but, I can say the photos, look great especially the videos there, is no comparison from the android side.2. Battery Life (I am using two sims): This was one of the areas of concern when ordering this phone, but I am relieved to say the battery life is good it's a one-day phone.3. Privacy and security: The best part, users have control over apps on what they can access and whatnot.4. OS Fluidity: The cohesiveness of the IOS is great previously, I have been using an android phone having a higher refresh rate screen, but I am not feeling any difference in day to day usage because of the cohesion and fluidity of the OS.Cons:Coming from Andriod you are used to doing things in a simple manner, but in IOS there are certain things that require extra steps or missing features. For example, in android, if you what to call someone, you just need to type the initials of that person on the dial pad, and you will get the suggestion, but you cannot do this on IOS.Dual sim options on Andoird is way better.This is my initial impression after using the Phone for 10 days. I Will update after using the phone for a bit longer.

  Quality of the phone is no where compromised, exceptional look and feel, very compact yet heavy powerful. Camera is excellent as we expect from apple, usage of applications are extremely smooth. High end graphics games works like a charm, 4K video editing is silky smooth as well. Only big disadvantage in this phone is the battery life, it is very pathetic. Hardly stands for a day with medium level of usage, when I say medium jus browsing YouTube a while, listening some music from iTunes, using camera a while and few phone calls and chats. On a heavy usage day battery needs to be charged twice at least, heavy usage for me considered as taking videos and using the edit suite for a while, playing some music, browsing and some phone calls and chats. It is understandable that smaller the phone smaller the capacity of the battery however when a price is being paid for the premium phone, it will be only fair if apple can improve in this area as well with some innovations.

  Quality of the phone is no where compromised, exceptional look and feel, very compact yet heavy powerful. Camera is excellent as we expect from apple, usage of applications are extremely smooth. High end graphics games works like a charm, 4K video editing is silky smooth as well. Only big disadvantage in this phone is the battery life, it is very pathetic. Hardly stands for a day with medium level of usage, when I say medium jus browsing YouTube a while, listening some music from iTunes, using camera a while and few phone calls and chats. On a heavy usage day battery needs to be charged twice at least, heavy usage for me considered as taking videos and using the edit suite for a while, playing some music, browsing and some phone calls and chats. It is understandable that smaller the phone smaller the capacity of the battery however when a price is being paid for the premium phone, it will be only fair if apple can improve in this area as well with some innovations.

I actually bought this for the camera specs. You can blindly click , record , edit and share using the phone only. You dont need any laptop unless you need to edit some very high 4k or professional files.Just go for it. It wont disappoint you.

  1. This is my first Apple phone. Also I wanted a small sized phone. So this is good for me.2. I don't use phone much. For social media like insta, FB, YouTube I use only for 1 hour. So battery life isn't a problem for me. I charge it in the morning and it goes till 8-9 PM. And still it works. The phone never got to 0% battery.3. I switched off the automatic brightness option for the battery to last long.4. Usually I switch on the mobile data or wifi if only I am using it continuously. Otherwise I keep it off. It saves me from unnecessary notifications and also help me keep the battery alive. I used to do it even when I was using and Android phone.5. If you need a small phone and if you are an average user of phone then you can go for it. But if you are a heavy user I would recommend iPhone 12 or the bigger versions - 12 pro max.. Etc.6. Very powerful. Convenient to use. And the most beautiful thing is it is small and goes inside my pocket so comfortably.7. Do use a cover/case. That way you can increase the grip. Otherwise it may slip away from your hands.8. I have also purchased an apple charger 20 W. So it gets charged faster.9. Firstly it was a little difficult for me to move from Android to iPhone. But trust me you'll get used to it. I am still learning it's features and tricks to use.10. I won't write about the specifications coz those are available.

  This is my first-time experience IOS/iPhone because I have been an Android user from the start. I was tired of the large phone, and I was looking for a compact phone, but there is no option available on the Android side hence, I switched to an iPhone. Here are my initial experience, I won't call it a value for money phone even after applying the offers, it's still a bit expensive.Pros:1. Camera: I don't take that many photos but, I can say the photos, look great especially the videos there, is no comparison from the android side.2. Battery Life (I am using two sims): This was one of the areas of concern when ordering this phone, but I am relieved to say the battery life is good it's a one-day phone.3. Privacy and security: The best part, users have control over apps on what they can access and whatnot.4. OS Fluidity: The cohesiveness of the IOS is great previously, I have been using an android phone having a higher refresh rate screen, but I am not feeling any difference in day to day usage because of the cohesion and fluidity of the OS.Cons:Coming from Andriod you are used to doing things in a simple manner, but in IOS there are certain things that require extra steps or missing features.

So battery life isn't a problem for me. I charge it in the morning and it goes till 8-9 PM. And still it works. The phone never got to 0% battery.3. I switched off the automatic brightness option for the battery to last long.4. Usually I switch on the mobile data or wifi if only I am using it continuously. Otherwise I keep it off. It saves me from unnecessary notifications and also help me keep the battery alive. I used to do it even when I was using and Android phone.5. If you need a small phone and if you are an average user of phone then you can go for it. But if you are a heavy user I would recommend iPhone 12 or the bigger versions - 12 pro max.. Etc.6. Very powerful. Convenient to use. And the most beautiful thing is it is small and goes inside my pocket so comfortably.7. Do use a cover/case. That way you can increase the grip. Otherwise it may slip away from your hands.8. I have also purchased an apple charger 20 W. So it gets charged faster.9. Firstly it was a little difficult for me to move from Android to iPhone. But trust me you'll get used to it. I am still learning it's features and tricks to use.10. I won't write about the specifications coz those are available.

  This is my first-time experience IOS/iPhone because I have been an Android user from the start. I was tired of the large phone, and I was looking for a compact phone, but there is no option available on the Android side hence, I switched to an iPhone. Here are my initial experience, I won't call it a value for money phone even after applying the offers, it's still a bit expensive.Pros:1. Camera: I don't take that many photos but, I can say the photos, look great especially the videos there, is no comparison from the android side.2. Battery Life (I am using two sims): This was one of the areas of concern when ordering this phone, but I am relieved to say the battery life is good it's a one-day phone.3. Privacy and security: The best part, users have control over apps on what they can access and whatnot.4. OS Fluidity: The cohesiveness of the IOS is great previously, I have been using an android phone having a higher refresh rate screen, but I am not feeling any difference in day to day usage because of the cohesion and fluidity of the OS.Cons:Coming from Andriod you are used to doing things in a simple manner, but in IOS there are certain things that require extra steps or missing features. For example, in android, if you what to call someone, you just need to type the initials of that person on the dial pad, and you will get the suggestion, but you cannot do this on IOS.Dual sim options on Andoird is way better.This is my initial impression after using the Phone for 10 days. I Will update after using the phone for a bit longer.

  Quality of the phone is no where compromised, exceptional look and feel, very compact yet heavy powerful. Camera is excellent as we expect from apple, usage of applications are extremely smooth. High end graphics games works like a charm, 4K video editing is silky smooth as well. Only big disadvantage in this phone is the battery life, it is very pathetic. Hardly stands for a day with medium level of usage, when I say medium jus browsing YouTube a while, listening some music from iTunes, using camera a while and few phone calls and chats. On a heavy usage day battery needs to be charged twice at least, heavy usage for me considered as taking videos and using the edit suite for a while, playing some music, browsing and some phone calls and chats. It is understandable that smaller the phone smaller the capacity of the battery however when a price is being paid for the premium phone, it will be only fair if apple can improve in this area as well with some innovations.

  Writing review after 3-4 days of general usage, day in and out.Hands down it’s One of the best sizes available in a smartphone without much compromises. Example of how a portable device should be like.Performance is exceptional.Display (Notched) and sound are good.Cameras are okay as compared to competitors.Battery life is a BitterSweet experience, it is above average, I am personally coming from Xr, it is actually comparable to it. After being charged to 98% at 9 AM it managed to have almost 50% remaining at around with many calls on 4G network, 30-40 min of msging, 50-60 min video streaming and 15-20 min of audio, all over a Bluetooth headset. It drains like shit if the brightness increases or if some graphic intense task/game is played. On the other hand the battery is so small that it feels like a matter of no time to charge it, that’s the sweet experience. I use 12W apple charger.@Apple: if you are reading this, not all users  are migrating from an apple device and type C to lightening sucks as the user should buy a type c out charger or the older lightening cable to use it with old chargers and that is against your quote of limiting the Carbon footprint. Hypocrites!Love it for:Size, performanceHate it for:Prize for the package - it’s not a cheap phone to buy, I would have liked the third camera with Lidar and RAW file formats supported by the Pro models even if the price was raised a bit (some thing like a iPhone Mini Pro would be a dream come true). Discrimination should not be on the basis of just the size.Storage and Ram: 64gb in this day and age even for a base model flagship is too low for a phone this capable ( I would suggest to go for 128gb variant) and RAM as of now is okay but it will be a limiting factor in few areas.Overall experience is kind of amazing (For an above average user).Hit thumbs if you liked the review, drop comments if you have any suggestions or questions.

   Believe me guys... I got it in 60,490 after using that offer on credit card. Obviously a steal deal. But the phone is awesome , battery life , camera and its functionality my god.. I actually bought this for the camera specs. You can blindly click , record , edit and share using the phone only. You dont need any laptop unless you need to edit some very high 4k or professional files.Just go for it. It wont disappoint you.

   Believe me guys... I got it in 60,490 after using that offer on credit card. Obviously a steal deal. But the phone is awesome , battery life , camera and its functionality my god.. I actually bought this for the camera specs. You can blindly click , record , edit and share using the phone only. You dont need any laptop unless you need to edit some very high 4k or professional files.Just go for it. It wont disappoint you.

  1. This is my first Apple phone. Also I wanted a small sized phone. So this is good for me.2. I don't use phone much. For social media like insta, FB, YouTube I use only for 1 hour. So battery life isn't a problem for me. I charge it in the morning and it goes till 8-9 PM. And still it works. The phone never got to 0% battery.3. I switched off the automatic brightness option for the battery to last long.4. Usually I switch on the mobile data or wifi if only I am using it continuously. Otherwise I keep it off. It saves me from unnecessary notifications and also help me keep the battery alive. I used to do it even when I was using and Android phone.5. If you need a small phone and if you are an average user of phone then you can go for it. But if you are a heavy user I would recommend iPhone 12 or the bigger versions - 12 pro max.. Etc.6. Very powerful. Convenient to use. And the most beautiful thing is it is small and goes inside my pocket so comfortably.7. Do use a cover/case. That way you can increase the grip. Otherwise it may slip away from your hands.8. I have also purchased an apple charger 20 W. So it gets charged faster.9. Firstly it was a little difficult for me to move from Android to iPhone. But trust me you'll get used to it. I am still learning it's features and tricks to use.10. I won't write about the specifications coz those are available.

  This is my first-time experience IOS/iPhone because I have been an Android user from the start. I was tired of the large phone, and I was looking for a compact phone, but there is no option available on the Android side hence, I switched to an iPhone. Here are my initial experience, I won't call it a value for money phone even after applying the offers, it's still a bit expensive.Pros:1. Camera: I don't take that many photos but, I can say the photos, look great especially the videos there, is no comparison from the android side.2. Battery Life (I am using two sims): This was one of the areas of concern when ordering this phone, but I am relieved to say the battery life is good it's a one-day phone.3. Privacy and security: The best part, users have control over apps on what they can access and whatnot.4. OS Fluidity: The cohesiveness of the IOS is great previously, I have been using an android phone having a higher refresh rate screen, but I am not feeling any difference in day to day usage because of the cohesion and fluidity of the OS.Cons:Coming from Andriod you are used to doing things in a simple manner, but in IOS there are certain things that require extra steps or missing features. For example, in android, if you what to call someone, you just need to type the initials of that person on the dial pad, and you will get the suggestion, but you cannot do this on IOS.Dual sim options on Andoird is way better.This is my initial impression after using the Phone for 10 days. I Will update after using the phone for a bit longer.

  Quality of the phone is no where compromised, exceptional look and feel, very compact yet heavy powerful. Camera is excellent as we expect from apple, usage of applications are extremely smooth. High end graphics games works like a charm, 4K video editing is silky smooth as well. Only big disadvantage in this phone is the battery life, it is very pathetic. Hardly stands for a day with medium level of usage, when I say medium jus browsing YouTube a while, listening some music from iTunes, using camera a while and few phone calls and chats. On a heavy usage day battery needs to be charged twice at least, heavy usage for me considered as taking videos and using the edit suite for a while, playing some music, browsing and some phone calls and chats. It is understandable that smaller the phone smaller the capacity of the battery however when a price is being paid for the premium phone, it will be only fair if apple can improve in this area as well with some innovations.

Example of how a portable device should be like.Performance is exceptional.Display (Notched) and sound are good.Cameras are okay as compared to competitors.Battery life is a BitterSweet experience, it is above average, I am personally coming from Xr, it is actually comparable to it. After being charged to 98% at 9 AM it managed to have almost 50% remaining at around with many calls on 4G network, 30-40 min of msging, 50-60 min video streaming and 15-20 min of audio, all over a Bluetooth headset. It drains like shit if the brightness increases or if some graphic intense task/game is played.

   Believe me guys... I got it in 60,490 after using that offer on credit card. Obviously a steal deal. But the phone is awesome , battery life , camera and its functionality my god.. I actually bought this for the camera specs. You can blindly click , record , edit and share using the phone only. You dont need any laptop unless you need to edit some very high 4k or professional files.Just go for it. It wont disappoint you.

  1. This is my first Apple phone. Also I wanted a small sized phone. So this is good for me.2. I don't use phone much. For social media like insta, FB, YouTube I use only for 1 hour. So battery life isn't a problem for me. I charge it in the morning and it goes till 8-9 PM. And still it works. The phone never got to 0% battery.3. I switched off the automatic brightness option for the battery to last long.4. Usually I switch on the mobile data or wifi if only I am using it continuously. Otherwise I keep it off. It saves me from unnecessary notifications and also help me keep the battery alive. I used to do it even when I was using and Android phone.5. If you need a small phone and if you are an average user of phone then you can go for it. But if you are a heavy user I would recommend iPhone 12 or the bigger versions - 12 pro max.. Etc.6. Very powerful. Convenient to use. And the most beautiful thing is it is small and goes inside my pocket so comfortably.7. Do use a cover/case. That way you can increase the grip. Otherwise it may slip away from your hands.8. I have also purchased an apple charger 20 W. So it gets charged faster.9. Firstly it was a little difficult for me to move from Android to iPhone. But trust me you'll get used to it. I am still learning it's features and tricks to use.10. I won't write about the specifications coz those are available.

  This is my first-time experience IOS/iPhone because I have been an Android user from the start. I was tired of the large phone, and I was looking for a compact phone, but there is no option available on the Android side hence, I switched to an iPhone. Here are my initial experience, I won't call it a value for money phone even after applying the offers, it's still a bit expensive.Pros:1. Camera: I don't take that many photos but, I can say the photos, look great especially the videos there, is no comparison from the android side.2. Battery Life (I am using two sims): This was one of the areas of concern when ordering this phone, but I am relieved to say the battery life is good it's a one-day phone.3. Privacy and security: The best part, users have control over apps on what they can access and whatnot.4. OS Fluidity: The cohesiveness of the IOS is great previously, I have been using an android phone having a higher refresh rate screen, but I am not feeling any difference in day to day usage because of the cohesion and fluidity of the OS.Cons:Coming from Andriod you are used to doing things in a simple manner, but in IOS there are certain things that require extra steps or missing features. For example, in android, if you what to call someone, you just need to type the initials of that person on the dial pad, and you will get the suggestion, but you cannot do this on IOS.Dual sim options on Andoird is way better.This is my initial impression after using the Phone for 10 days. I Will update after using the phone for a bit longer.

  This is my first-time experience IOS/iPhone because I have been an Android user from the start. I was tired of the large phone, and I was looking for a compact phone, but there is no option available on the Android side hence, I switched to an iPhone. Here are my initial experience, I won't call it a value for money phone even after applying the offers, it's still a bit expensive.Pros:1. Camera: I don't take that many photos but, I can say the photos, look great especially the videos there, is no comparison from the android side.2. Battery Life (I am using two sims): This was one of the areas of concern when ordering this phone, but I am relieved to say the battery life is good it's a one-day phone.3. Privacy and security: The best part, users have control over apps on what they can access and whatnot.4. OS Fluidity: The cohesiveness of the IOS is great previously, I have been using an android phone having a higher refresh rate screen, but I am not feeling any difference in day to day usage because of the cohesion and fluidity of the OS.Cons:Coming from Andriod you are used to doing things in a simple manner, but in IOS there are certain things that require extra steps or missing features. For example, in android, if you what to call someone, you just need to type the initials of that person on the dial pad, and you will get the suggestion, but you cannot do this on IOS.Dual sim options on Andoird is way better.This is my initial impression after using the Phone for 10 days. I Will update after using the phone for a bit longer.

  Had to get the device replaced due to 'Hardware issue' after the phone did not switch on post regular charging. Apple service centre checked and replaced the phone in a week.The additional expenses on scratch guard, waiting time, photos taken all are gone.

  Quality of the phone is no where compromised, exceptional look and feel, very compact yet heavy powerful. Camera is excellent as we expect from apple, usage of applications are extremely smooth. High end graphics games works like a charm, 4K video editing is silky smooth as well. Only big disadvantage in this phone is the battery life, it is very pathetic. Hardly stands for a day with medium level of usage, when I say medium jus browsing YouTube a while, listening some music from iTunes, using camera a while and few phone calls and chats. On a heavy usage day battery needs to be charged twice at least, heavy usage for me considered as taking videos and using the edit suite for a while, playing some music, browsing and some phone calls and chats. It is understandable that smaller the phone smaller the capacity of the battery however when a price is being paid for the premium phone, it will be only fair if apple can improve in this area as well with some innovations.

  Whoa! This a pretty powerful phone in a cute small size. I love the size. Only issue is battery is smaller because of small phone, but for me it is decent as I don’t use phone that much. Awesome display, awesome camera.

  Since it’s an era of large screen phones, it’s good to have a compact smartphone with latest innovation and absolutely powerful chipset. Camera is astonishing.

  Writing review after 3-4 days of general usage, day in and out.Hands down it’s One of the best sizes available in a smartphone without much compromises. Example of how a portable device should be like.Performance is exceptional.Display (Notched) and sound are good.Cameras are okay as compared to competitors.Battery life is a BitterSweet experience, it is above average, I am personally coming from Xr, it is actually comparable to it. After being charged to 98% at 9 AM it managed to have almost 50% remaining at around with many calls on 4G network, 30-40 min of msging, 50-60 min video streaming and 15-20 min of audio, all over a Bluetooth headset. It drains like shit if the brightness increases or if some graphic intense task/game is played. On the other hand the battery is so small that it feels like a matter of no time to charge it, that’s the sweet experience. I use 12W apple charger.@Apple: if you are reading this, not all users  are migrating from an apple device and type C to lightening sucks as the user should buy a type c out charger or the older lightening cable to use it with old chargers and that is against your quote of limiting the Carbon footprint. Hypocrites!Love it for:Size, performanceHate it for:Prize for the package - it’s not a cheap phone to buy, I would have liked the third camera with Lidar and RAW file formats supported by the Pro models even if the price was raised a bit (some thing like a iPhone Mini Pro would be a dream come true). Discrimination should not be on the basis of just the size.Storage and Ram: 64gb in this day and age even for a base model flagship is too low for a phone this capable ( I would suggest to go for 128gb variant) and RAM as of now is okay but it will be a limiting factor in few areas.Overall experience is kind of amazing (For an above average user).Hit thumbs if you liked the review, drop comments if you have any suggestions or questions.

  Its awesome. Its my first iPhone and I started loving it. You might have to buy Apple's 20W adapter if you want to have fast charging experience. But overall it is a cute small but very powerful device. Absolutely technical magic from Apple!!

   Believe me guys... I got it in 60,490 after using that offer on credit card. Obviously a steal deal. But the phone is awesome , battery life , camera and its functionality my god.. I actually bought this for the camera specs. You can blindly click , record , edit and share using the phone only. You dont need any laptop unless you need to edit some very high 4k or professional files.Just go for it. It wont disappoint you.

  1. This is my first Apple phone. Also I wanted a small sized phone. So this is good for me.2. I don't use phone much. For social media like insta, FB, YouTube I use only for 1 hour. So battery life isn't a problem for me. I charge it in the morning and it goes till 8-9 PM. And still it works. The phone never got to 0% battery.3. I switched off the automatic brightness option for the battery to last long.4. Usually I switch on the mobile data or wifi if only I am using it continuously. Otherwise I keep it off. It saves me from unnecessary notifications and also help me keep the battery alive. I used to do it even when I was using and Android phone.5. If you need a small phone and if you are an average user of phone then you can go for it. But if you are a heavy user I would recommend iPhone 12 or the bigger versions - 12 pro max.. Etc.6. Very powerful. Convenient to use. And the most beautiful thing is it is small and goes inside my pocket so comfortably.7. Do use a cover/case. That way you can increase the grip. Otherwise it may slip away from your hands.8. I have also purchased an apple charger 20 W. So it gets charged faster.9. Firstly it was a little difficult for me to move from Android to iPhone. But trust me you'll get used to it. I am still learning it's features and tricks to use.10. I won't write about the specifications coz those are available.
